# Inf

**Influence**, **Infamy**, and **Information**, commonly known as *Inf*, is the currency that is earned by defeating opponents, completing missions and selling items. It is used to buy Inspirations, Enhancements, and Costumes. Inf can be traded by mail through characters of any alignment.

## Inf Cap

### Original

In the original, free players could only hold 25 million inf. Premium players could increase this cap using reward tokens.

- 1 Reward Token: 25,000,000 (25 million) per character (Free players occupy this tier)
- 2 Reward Tokens: 500,000,000 (500 million) per character
- 5 Reward Tokens: 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) per character
- 8 Reward Tokens: 2,000,000,000 (2 billion) per character

VIP Players have an inf limit of 2 billion regardless of how many Reward Tokens they have earned.

### Homecoming

Because VIP is granted to players by default in Homecoming, all characters can have up to 2 billion Inf regardless of the amount of reward tokens they have. As CoH was formally a subscription-based game, the economy was likely already adjusted to taken into account the billion Inf as it is hardly a complaint.

## Understanding Inf

Inf. is used as an abstraction layer over more descriptive or intuitive currencies, such as "Credits" or "Dollars," because each hero or villain created in City of Heroes (and in general) because all have diverse range of origins that using something ore specific would not be suitable.

### Examples

As illustrative examples, consider the in-game stories behind three of the Signature Heroes.

Mynx is a young, college-age woman who was granted super-powers against her will by the corrupt Crey Corporation. As a young woman, she doesn't really have a lot of financial clout. However, her repeated service to the city has ensured that when she needs resources to help fight crime, those resources will be available to her regardless of how much money (paper currency) she has on her person or in a bank account.

Mynx's earned Influence is primarily in the form of "good will" support available to her from her allies and the businesses located in Paragon City.

Manticore is an adult man who inherited a vast fortune and runs powerful businesses. His real identity is not particularly well known. As a more secretive hero, he's not likely to depend upon the good will of the city or his allies for support. Rather, he'll purchase it outright or use his existing financial assets to manufacture what he can't purchase.

Manticore's Influence is primarily in the form of his vast financial assets.

Statesman is an immortal being who's been protecting the city and the world for the better part of a century. He was a wealthy man when he began his exploits as Statesman, and we can assume that he's been responsible with that wealth. He's been active in the fight against evil for so long that he's become the very epitome of heroism to many in the city.

Statesman's Influence comprises not only the good will of the city and his extensive personal financial resources, but is also bolstered by the sheer amount of authority and expertise he wields.
